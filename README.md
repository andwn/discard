# Discard
Unfinished Android client for Discord.
Uses a modified [Discord4J](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J).

**This is a dead project. Use [bitlbee-discord](https://github.com/sm00th/bitlbee-discord) with an IRC client instead.**

## Download
Last version is in the releases tab. Expect NPEs.

## Build
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the folder in Android Studio
3. Hit run
4. Pray

### Why make this?

- Discord4Droid: GPLv2+ (same as Discord4J)
